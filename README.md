## Findings & Insights — Online Bookstore Analysis
1. Sales Performance

The analysis revealed consistent sales across popular genres such as Fiction, Science, and Self-Help, contributing the most to overall revenue.

Top 10 best-selling books accounted for a significant percentage of total orders, showing that a few key titles drive a large portion of sales.

Books priced between ₹300–₹700 had the highest sales volume, suggesting that mid-priced books are most attractive to customers.

2. Customer Insights

A large proportion of purchases came from repeat customers, indicating good customer retention.

City-based segmentation showed that customers from metro areas (like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore) contributed over 60% of total revenue.

Email-based analysis suggested a high potential for targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.

3. Revenue & Profit Trends

The average order value (AOV) was moderate, with occasional spikes during festive months (likely linked to promotions).

Genres like Educational and Business showed higher profit margins despite lower volume, indicating a premium pricing opportunity.

Seasonal peaks were observed during November–December, correlating with the holiday gift-buying period.

4. Inventory Analysis

Several books had low stock but high demand, flagging them for restocking priority.

A few titles remained in stock for long periods — potential candidates for discount campaigns or bundle offers.

Inventory turnover analysis helped identify underperforming categories that need review.

5. Operational Insights

Proper use of foreign keys and relationships between Customers, Books, and Orders enabled seamless data joining for reports.

Queries involving JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING efficiently summarized data for business insights.

The structure supports expansion to include Publishers, Authors, or Payments tables for deeper analysis.
